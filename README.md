# Technical Questions Questionnaire  
Quiz to help better understand technical questions  

## User Story  
  
As a junior developer, I want to be able to work on studying potential technical questions to better prepare myself for interviews.  
  

## Acceptance Criteria  
   
It is done when I am prompted to log in,  
then if I don't have a log in,
I am prompted to sign up.
Once I have signed up, I am able to then log in.  
Once I log in, I'm able to go through the questionnaire.   
After I make it through the questionnaire or time runs out, 
then I am prompted with how many I got correct up until that point.
My scores will then persist,
until I clear the table.
